# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

In this project, we decided to look at the correlation between outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on their fundraising goals

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise better understand correlation with how her fundraising campaign went compared to other campaigns. The first data that we pulled at is on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" worksheet. You can see where we looked at the success of campaigns across a 12-month period. We split out the data using a pivot table. From there we could see whether the campaign was canceled, failed, still live, or successful. We were then able to display the data in a line chart to look for any trends. The next data that we pulled was to look at the relationship between the outcomes based on their fundraising goal amount. To do this we created a simple table using rows and columns. The first part was to count the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns and list them based on their fundraising amount. The next step was to add up the total number of campaigns, regardless of amount, based on their fundraising goal amount. From there we were able to calculate a percentage based on whether the campaign was successful, failed, or was canceled.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion that I'm able to draw from the data is that the highest number of successful campaigns occurred in May, June, then July. November and December appeared to have the lowest number of successful campaigns. The second conclusion that I had was that there was not as big of a swing with the failed campaigns like there were with the successful ones. There is a clear difference in the way the successful line looks to the failed line. The line is consistent throughout the year before a dip in September followed by a spike in October. October was also the only month without a canceled campaign on record.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I can conclude from looking at the "Outcomes based on Goals" worksheet that most campaigns were for less than $5,000. We can also see that almost half of the entire kickstarter campaigns were in the “$1,000 to $5,000 dollar” range. The "Less than 1000" and "1000 to 4999" ranges had the most frequency so it's not surprising to see them also have the two highest successful percentage rates. There was also a pretty big drop in the number of total projects once you get past the fundraising goal of $10,000. There was some success as we got into the higher fundraising goal ranges, but it was spotty. One other interesting thing that I noticed was that there were not any canceled fundraising campaigns for the subcategory "plays".

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
