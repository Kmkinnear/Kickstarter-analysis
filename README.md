#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

This project sought to help Louise who was interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, "Fever". She estimated that she would need a budget of around $10,000 to complete her play. The goal of this analysis was to look at data from other kickstarter campaigns and give Louise some better insight as to what she should expect. We'll take a look at campaigns that were successful, as well as ones that failed, and attempt to find specific factors that determined their fate. Once we have sorted through the data, we'll report our findings back to Louise.

##Findings

We can look at the chart and see that May and June were the most successful months for kickstarter campaigns. We can also see that September and December had the lowest number of successful campaigns.

We can look at this chart and see that the top three number of kickstarter campaigns are in theater, music, and film & video. We can also see that these three categories have the highest number of successful campaigns. 

The average goal for theater/plays campaigns was around $5,000 which is half of Louise's budget. The average pledge was $5,600 among successful campaigns. 

##Recommendations

The good news for Louise is that the theater/plays category is one of the most successful of the kickstarter campaigns. The bad news for Louise is that her budget is about twice of what the typical successful pledge is. The mean goal for failed campaigns was $10,554 which is slightly over what she is looking to raise. My recommendation to Louise would be to try and find a way to cut cost to help bring her campaign goal down to have a better chance of success. I would also recommend that she start her campaign in May or June at the latest. These two months showed to have the best chance for success.
